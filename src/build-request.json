Add the uploaded image file(s) to frontend/public/assets/generated and update only this image element’s src to reference the uploaded asset via the existing base-aware assetPath() helper.",

        "The uploaded image file used by the <img> exists at frontend/public/assets/generated/<filename>.webp and loads correctly in both local dev and IC deployments served from a subpath (i.e., no hard-coded leading '/' in the src).",
